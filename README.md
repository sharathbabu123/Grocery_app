# Grocery Inventory App

A Flutter application that uses the device camera to scan your pantry. While capturing video, detected food items are automatically listed in the app.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
2. Retrieve dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app on a connected device or emulator:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

The application will display the camera preview and a running list of items detected using Google's ML Kit object detector.
